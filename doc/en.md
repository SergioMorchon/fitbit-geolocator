# Geolocator

GPS based app to store locations and orientate yourself:
✔ Add your current position to your locations list.
✔ Show the distance between you and the target.
✔ Show the straight direction to the target position.

ℹ How does it work?

- To add a location, you can do it either from the watch or from the settings section (⚙). If you do it from the watch, it will use your current coordinates and generate the name with them.
- Locations are stored by their name, so if you add a new one with an already existing name, it will overwrite it.

Bear in mind that:

- Fitbit devices has no compass, so the orientation is calculated based on your latest GPS movements.
- If your Fitbit device has no built-in GPS, you'll need to have it connected to your smartphone with GPS.
